# Chainlink Constellation Hackathon Submission

## Project Name: ChainBot ðŸ¤–

### Overview

Welcome to the official repository of ChainBot, my submission for the Chainlink Constellation Hackathon. ChainBot is a versatile and user-friendly bot designed to streamline various tasks within the Ethereum/Polygon ecosystem using nothing but Chainlink functions. This bot empowers users to perform swaps, check ENS domains, and execute Chainlink functions seamlessly. This bot helps new and experience an interaction with blockcahin services with nothing but day to day natural language and the saftety of a burner wallet.

### Features

1. **Swap Functionality:**
   - ChainBot allows users to perform token swaps directly through Chainlink functions.
   - Users can specify the tokens they want to swap and the desired amount, and ChainBot handles the rest using decentralized price feeds and liquidity pools.

2. **ENS Domain Checker:**
   - Explore the world of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) seamlessly with ChainBot.
   - Simply provide the ENS domain you want to check, and ChainBot retrieves relevant information using Chainlink oracles.

3. **Chainlink Function Execution:**
   - ChainBot acts as a gateway to execute various Chainlink functions without the need for complex setups.
   - Users can interact with Chainlink's decentralized oracle network effortlessly, leveraging the power of smart contracts.
    
4. **DCA:**
    - Dollar cost averaging with natural language
    - Stop the fuction with natural languaage

### How to Use ChainBot

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChainBot.git
